In any programming language , Variables are containers or boxes for storing data values.
Lets take a simple real world examples. If we have some fruits and some juices , so we store all the fruits in a box and we store all 
the juice in bottles. We dont store fruit in bottles and we dont store juice in boxes. So from this example we understand that for 
specific type of things  to be stored we use specific type of containers like box or bottles. In same way in the world of computer 
programming , we have differnt kind of datatypes like int,float,str. So we store int values in int box(variable), float value in 
float box (variable), and str value in str box (variable). So to create the variable in programming languages we have to give our variable 
any name and we have to write the datatype of variable means of which dataype value our variable will store like int or float or str,
then we can assign value to our variable to store inside it.

********* Some examples of Declaring or Creating variables in programming languages***************************************************************

 [ EXAMPLE 1 ] int x = 21 
 In the above example, on left side of assignment operator(=) , we have int that tell computer about datatype of variable x,
 then after int we have x that is the name of our variable, and on right side of our assignment operator we have 21. Means now 
 our x variable has a value of 21. 
 
 [ EXAMPLE 2 ] float y = 21.78 
 In the above example, on left side of assignment operator(=) , we have float that tell computer about datatype of variable y,
 then after float we have y that is the name of our variable, and on right side of our assignment operator we have 21.78 Means now 
 our y variable has a value of 21.78 
 
 [ EXAMPLE 3 ] str country = "Mars nation"
 In the above example, on left side of assignment operator(=) , we have str that tell computer about datatype of variable country,
 then after str we have country that is the name of our variable, and on right side of our assignment operator we have "Mars nation".
 Means now our country variable has a value of "Mars nation".

********************    RULES TO CREATE OR DECLARE VARIABLES IN PYTHON      ************************************************
RULE 1 :- In python programming language , we dont have to specify the data type of the variable like int or float or str.
RULE 2 :- String variables can be declared either by using single or double quotes and int and float variables dont need quotes.
RULE 3 :- A variable can have a short name like x and y or a more descriptive name height, bikename, total_heihgt.
RULE 4 :- A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character.
RULE 5 :- A variable name cannot start with a number.
RULE 6 :- A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ ).
RULE 7 :-Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables).

********* PROGRAMMES ON VARIABLES ****************
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(1) WRITE A PYTHON PROGRAM TO DECLARE TWO VARIABLES OF NAME X AND Y AND ASSIGN VALUE 20 TO X AND ASSIGN VALUE 30 TO Y AND THEN USE PRINT
FUNCTION TO ADD BOTH OF THESE VARIABLES.
""" x = 20
    y = 30
    print(x+y) """
