COMMENTS IN PYTHON:-

COMMENTS are used in every programming language .Comments are wriiten in the programs to remember which code does which 
action. Comments are written within the program and the compiler or intrepreter ignores comments. Some times we have thousands of lines 
of code in our software or website or app , lets conside we have ecommerce app like amazon now in amazon app there is lots of code
written to do specific job like some code to register users, some code to display products, some code to make payments, etc so there
is going to be huge lines of code , now next time if we open our code project we should be able to easily find which code does which 
job. so inside that  code we use comments to remember the use of that specific lines of code and if some other programmer comes to work
in our project , then this comments will explain them what a specific code does in that project.Comments can be used to make the code 
more readable.
